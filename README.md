# MetroSimulation
This project is a Python application that performs route finding and visualization operations for a metro network.  BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithm finds the east transfer route,  A* algorithm calculates the fastest path and  NetworkX + Matplotlib graphically visualizes the metro network.
